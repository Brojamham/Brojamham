I've been trying to use assembly. I have an interest in operating systems and vintage computers, mainly the components that run them, my interest is more into 8-bit and 16-bit architecture. I love tables that show large amounts of data, especially if they are completely text based. For example, if I were to make something like this:

00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5
00AF: A
000A: X
0F01: 22
0010: 3
F100: 5


Now, this format is rather nonsensical, but it is pretty much what I mean, I'm interested in this, this format in particular. Things that are rather hexadecimal-esque.

Anyway, I felt like updating this, because I felt like my original readme was trying to hard to be funny or nonchalant, and thought this was a much better representative of how I actually am, and gives a helpful insight into what I am interested in. Now, it is unlikely that it matters that you get this insight, but if you're reading this, then you have it now...
